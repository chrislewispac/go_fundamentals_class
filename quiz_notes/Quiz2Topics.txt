Quiz two will take you an hour to finish, but I have given you 70 minutes 
to finish. Once you start the quiz, you will have to finish it in one sitting; 
breaks are not allowed during the quiz. If you stop in the middle of the quiz, 
your time will expire and you will be graded for the questions that you have 
answered.

Please understand that if you start the quiz 30 minutes prior to the 
cut off time, you will not get a full hour to finish the quiz. You will need 
to start the quiz a minimum of one hour before the cut off time.
